## Abstract

This document describes a system for distributed symbolic reasoning and schema-emergent memory across a decentralized pub/sub mesh. It introduces the Universal Attribute (ATTR) model, a recursive symbolic representation, and outlines a real-time Thinking Mesh Protocol that enables querying, reasoning, and self-organizing memory across multiple agent nodes using the Zenoh transport layer.

This disclosure establishes the described methods and architectures as prior art to prevent exclusive patenting and promote open research and development.

;

## 1. Universal Attribute Model

All data is represented using recursive symbolic structures of the form:

```
attribute: [attribute: [attribute: [...]]]
```

Each attribute may be:
- A symbolic label
- A scalar value  
- A nested structure

This model supports:
- Schema-free knowledge representation
- Symbolic compression via structure unification
- Self-describing generalizations and meta-schemas

;

## 2. Symbolic Memory Architecture

The system includes:
- **Episodic Memory**: A time-indexed log of ATTR-based observations
- **Schema Cache**: Templates generalized from recurring patterns
- **Concept Store**: Folded structures representing higher-order symbolic concepts
- **Working Memory**: Query context + partial bindings
- **Query Engine**: Pattern matcher with variable binding and symbolic filtering

;

## 3. Thinking Mesh Protocol (Zenoh-based)

This protocol defines symbolic interaction among autonomous agents over a Zenoh mesh.

**Agent Roles:**
- **Observer**: Publishes ATTR-based observations
- **Responder**: Matches and replies to symbolic queries
- **Reasoner**: Compresses symbolic structures into schemas
- **Planner**: Executes chained query plans
- **Mediator**: Bridges schema differences between nodes

**Keyspace Use:**

| Zenoh Path | Payload |
|------------|---------|
| `/ATTR/{node}/observation` | ATTR observation with timestamp |
| `/ATTR/{node}/query` | ATTR pattern query |
| `/ATTR/{node}/response/{uuid}` | Matching variable bindings |
| `/ATTR/{node}/schema` | Inferred schema patterns |

;

## 4. Novel Contributions

This system introduces:
- A recursive, schema-emergent symbolic memory model
- A real-time distributed symbolic protocol over decentralized mesh
- A pattern-based query mechanism that supports variable binding and symbolic generalization
- A method for federated reasoning and schema alignment across autonomous nodes without centralized knowledge or predefined ontology

;

## 5. Implementation Considerations

- The protocol is transport-agnostic but demonstrated using Zenoh (Apache 2.0)
- The ATTR model may be serialized as JSON, MsgPack, CBOR, or Protobuf
- Semantic queries may be declarative (match: pattern) or procedural (e.g., rule-based execution plans)

;

## 6. Applications

- Distributed cognitive agents
- Self-organizing sensor networks
- Federated AI systems
- Digital twins and edge intelligence
- LLM grounding and context unification
